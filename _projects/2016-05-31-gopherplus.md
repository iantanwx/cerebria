GopherPlus is a pretty standard brochure-style website.

Due to challenges with responsiveness given the design of the home page, I used SASS and the excellent [`modular-scale`](https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass) mixin to achieve meaningful relationships between sizes in this site's typography.

Additionally, a lot of CSS hacking went into it, in order to force the design to be platable on mobile devices.
